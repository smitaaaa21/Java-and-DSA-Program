Process of Instantiation:
1. Creating a variable to store the reference of the object.
2. Create an object using new keyword.
3. Assigning reference of the created object to the variable.

HEAP: It is shared 
STACK: Every method has its own stack.
Ex: Student S1= new Student();
Student S2= new Student();
S1=S2;
Earlier obj1 was pointing to S1 and obj2 was pointing to S2. As soon as we
wrote S1=S2, then obj1 became garbage value.
